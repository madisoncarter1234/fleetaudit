## Demo Script:

"Here's a sample week of data from a small NYC delivery company. As you can see, FleetAudit.io detected several concerning patterns including unauthorized after-hours vehicle use, excessive idling costing fuel, and potential fraud with ghost job entries. The system automatically flagged these for investigation, potentially saving thousands in operational costs."
