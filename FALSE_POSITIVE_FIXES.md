# False Positive Prevention & Edge Case Handling

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Time Period Mismatch Validation**
- **Problem**: System flagged fuel purchases as "theft" when GPS data was from different months
- **Fix**: Added date range analysis and overlap warnings
- **Result**: Clear UI warnings when data sources don't align temporally

### 2. **Realistic Commercial Vehicle Assumptions**
- **Problem**: Default 25-gallon tank too small for commercial vehicles
- **Fix**: Updated to 40-gallon default (commercial vehicle average)
- **Result**: Fewer false positives from legitimate large fuel purchases

### 3. **Price Tolerance Adjustments** 
- **Problem**: Too sensitive to regional fuel price variations
- **Fix**: 
  - Increased price tolerance from ±$0.25 to ±$0.40 per gallon
  - Raised price excess threshold from 30% to 50% over expected
  - Premium fuel threshold from +$1.50 to +$2.00 per gallon
- **Result**: Accounts for regional price differences and premium diesel

### 4. **DEF Fluid & Equipment Purchase Detection**
- **Problem**: DEF fluid purchases flagged as fuel theft
- **Fix**: Special detection for $15-60 purchases with <15 gallons
- **Result**: Reduced confidence (45%) for likely DEF/equipment purchases

### 5. **Emergency Refueling Scenarios** 
- **Problem**: Legitimate emergency refills flagged as suspicious
- **Fix**: 
  - Detect previous purchases <5 gallons (ran out of gas)
  - Different locations suggest legitimate travel
  - Reduce confidence for emergency indicators
- **Result**: 60-80% confidence instead of 95% for potential emergencies

### 6. **Equipment & Multi-Vehicle Operations**
- **Problem**: Companies refueling generators, multiple vehicles flagged as theft
- **Fix**:
  - Increased daily excess threshold from 1.5x to 2.0x tank capacity
  - Detect small individual purchases (equipment refueling)
  - Multiple small purchases pattern recognition
- **Result**: 55-60% confidence for likely equipment operations

## Gallons Data Source Clarification

### ✅ **Fleet Fuel Cards** (WEX, FleetCor, Fuelman)
- **Include gallons data** in transaction exports
- **Best detection capability** (95% confidence)
- **Designed for fleet management** and consumption tracking

### ⚠️ **Regular Credit Cards**
- **Dollar amounts only** (no gallons)
- **Limited detection** using estimated volumes  
- **Less reliable** for volume-based theft detection

### 💡 **Customer Education**
- Added UI explanation of data quality differences
- Clear guidance on where to find gallons data
- Set proper expectations for detection capabilities

## Edge Cases Still Handled

1. **Long-haul truckers** - Daily refills considered normal for commercial operations
2. **Shift changes** - Different drivers, different consumption patterns
3. **Seasonal variations** - Pattern analysis adapts to individual driver baselines
4. **Premium vs regular fuel** - Wider price tolerance accounts for fuel grade differences
5. **Construction/service work** - Equipment refueling patterns recognized
6. **Regional fuel prices** - Increased tolerance for geographic price variations
7. **After-hours emergencies** - Emergency refill scenarios get reduced confidence

## Confidence Scoring System

- **95%**: Overwhelming evidence (tank overfill, massive rapid refills)
- **80-85%**: Strong evidence with minor uncertainty
- **60-70%**: Suspicious but potential legitimate explanations
- **45-55%**: Flagged but likely legitimate (DEF, equipment, emergencies)

## Result
System now focuses on "overwhelmingly obvious" theft scenarios while gracefully handling legitimate edge cases with appropriate confidence levels.
